Damage to the built infrastructure during hurricanes shows thepotential risk to critical coastal bridges. This risk could be higher in thefuture hurricanes because of climate change effects and sea-level riseand their impact on coastal zones. The goal of this research project isto provide DelDOT and other State agencies with the ability to simulatevarious combined storm scenarios for the purpose of understanding1what assets are vulnerable to damage.

Our research team proposes anine-step Adaptation Planning Framework (APF) to help DelDOT betterchoose cost-effective options to improve the networkâ€™s resiliency. Inspecific, this framework will consider what parameters should be usedin designing roads and bridges, how to manage travel during and afterdisasters, and the cost of maintaining transportation assets. The development of the Adaptation Policy Framework is intended to provide DelDOT with the rapidly evolving process of adaptation policy-making for reducing vulnerability to longer-term climate change.
